What is the most dangerous NYC borough / area for a bicycle rider? Use visualization.

The most dangerous NYC boroughs for a bicycle rider is Brooklyn. See Step 5 for the corresponding visualization


What would you change in the locations of bike stations to increase safety? Use visualization.

Move  bike stations to locations with no accidents happening nearby (e.g., Lat|Long = 40.69:40.75|-74.025:-74.100) 
-> More stations on Staten Island less in Brooklyn. See Step 6 & 7 for visualizations

Where can an accident occur and how close is this from the nearest bike station? Create a predictive
model.

For the creation of predictive models see Step 8-12. In Step 12 a plot of the Predicted Accidents Locations & Rental Bike Stations Locations is shown. In Step 13 the distance of the predicted accident locations to the nearest bike stations is calculated. In Step 14 the Predicted Accident Locations and the respective nearest bike stations are plotted. Most of the bike stations near to a predicted accident location are in Brooklyn.

What other data sources would be interesting to correlate?

Weather data: humidity, temperature, air pressure, visibility (e.g., reduced due to fog), wind direction & speed, sunrise or sunset

Tourist data: holidays, number of daily visitors/tourist

Bike Station Data: Number of available bikes of nearest station, number of bikes in use of nearest station
