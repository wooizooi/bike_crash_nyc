**Bicycle Accidents in NYC**

Use LM/KNN/Decision Tree/Random Forest regression algorithms from sklearn to predict the accident location. I will only select a few features I believe are more relevant to accident location. Categorical data will be treated with Pandas get_dummies method. Rows with missing values will be dropped.

Scenario and Data: NYC is known for its traffic jams. So, going around on a bike is a big time saver. But thereâ€™s some risk of having an accident. We have two datasets to do some research on them:

Bike Stations: https://feeds.citibikenyc.com/stations/stations.json

Vehicle crashes: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-CollisionsCrashes/h9gi-nx95

To load the data into the jupyter notebook run the code in Step 2 (# import from url). Alternatively: Download the data to your local device and load the data from there using the code in Step 2 (# import from device).
After loading the datasets run the code step by step.
